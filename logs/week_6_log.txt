Objective: Visualize and evaluate fire risk predictions from baseline and CNN models by creating interactive risk probability maps. 
Compare predicted high-risk zones with actual burned areas to assess model performance spatially.

Tasks Completed:
    - Interactive Visualization Pipeline
        - Developed an interactive Folium-based map interface.
        - Added dropdown and toggle controls to dynamically:
            - Select a specific fire event
            - Compare predicted fire risk maps from Logistic Regression, Random Forest and CNN models at the same time.
        - Overlaid model predictions as color-coded probability layers.
        - Included ground-truth burned area boundaries for direct spatial comparison with predicted risk zones.
    - Model Peformance Insights
        - Observed that CNN model outputs provided smoother spatial gradients and more defined burned area delineations.
        - Random Forest and Logistic Regression exhibited higher false-positive zones, especially around transitional vegetation types.

Next Steps:
    - Use the same 10 fire events to extract addition predictive features like:
        - Wind speed/direction
        - Topography
        - Fuel type and vegetation dryness indices
    - Build a labeled dataset for spread modeling:
        - Predict fire area at Day N + 1 from conditions and spread at Day N.
    - Begin designing and comparing spread prediction models.
