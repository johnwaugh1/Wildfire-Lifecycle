Objective: Finalize dataset for training by cleaning, aligning, and labeling raster data from multiple wildfire events.

Tasks Completed:
    - Multi-Fire Raster Loading:
        - Automatically detected fires in data/processed.
        - Loaded each fire's rasters (veg indices, drought indices, landcover, etc).
        - Used dNBR raster as reference grid to align all layers.
    - Cleaning and Masking:
        - Masked no-data pixels based on dNBR availability.
        - Dropped rows with NaNs to ensure clean training set.
        - Verified that features aligned properly.
    - Label Construuction:
        - Computed dNBR-based severity classification.
            - Unburned: dNBR < 0.1
            - Low: 0.1 ≤ dNBR < 0.27
            - Moderate: 0.27 ≤ dNBR < 0.44
            - High: dNBR ≥ 0.44
    - Exported Datasets:
        - Saved per-fire parquet files.
        - Created combined dataset with all fires stacked together for modeling.
    - Exploratory visualization:
        - Generated dNBR distribution plots for each fire.
        - Generated feature correlation heatmap across all features.

Next Steps:
    - Train baseline classifcation models, evaluate performance.
