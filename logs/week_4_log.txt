Objective: Develop initial fire risk classifcation models using the combined dataset
from multiple fire evetns. Evaluate the baseline model performance and interpret relevance
of features.

Tasks Completed:
    - Intergrated combined dataset:
        - Loaded the preprocessed dataset from multiple fire events.
        - Verified spatial alignment and consistent variable naming across all datasets.
        - Constructed a unified file with shared feature columns (dNBR, SPI, VCI, NDVI) and severity labels.
    - Feature Engineering:
        - Selected for core predictive features representing vegetation and drought conditions:
            - dNBR (Differenced Normalized Burn Ratio): burn severity indicator.
            - NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index): vegetation greeness and health.
            - VCI (Vegetation Condition Index): short-term vegetation stress.
            - SPI (Standardized Precipitation Index): drought and moisture anomaly metric.
        - Ensured all features were scaled to consistent numeric range.
    - Model Development:
        - Trained baseline models to predict burn severity classes (High, Moderate, Low, Unburned):
            - Logistic Regression: used as a linear baseline for interpretability.
            - Random Forest Classifier: nonlinear model for capturing vegetation-burn interactions.
    - Model Evaluation:
        - Split combined dataset into training (70%) and test (30%) subsets.
        - Evaluated models using confusion matrices, precision, recall, and AUC.
        - Observed both modesl achieving high overall accuracy but struggling to classify
        minority (burned) classes due to strong class imbalance.
        - Random Forest slighty outperformed Logistic Regression in recall for burned classes.
    - Feature Insight:
        - Extracted feature importance from Random Forest:
            - dNBR performed highly, confirming strong correlation with burn severity.
            - NDVI, VCI, and SPI showed context-dependent relevance.
        - Generated feature importance bar plots and confusion matrix visualizations for both models.
    - Saved baseline model metrics for future comparison.

Next Steps:
    - Address class imbalance issue somehow.
    - Introduce topographic features (slope, etc).
    - Train more advanced models (CNNs) for improved burned area detection.
    - Possibly add more fire events to combined dataset for better training.
