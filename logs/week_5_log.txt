Objective: Develop and evaluate an advanced deep learning model (CNN) for burn severity classification using
the combined multi-event dataset. Compare CNN performance against baseline models (Logistic Regression and Random Forest) 
and address dataset imbalance.

Tasks Completed:
    - Dataset Integration and Prep:
        - Utilized the expanded combined dataset containing additional historical fire events for improved generalization.
        - Verified consistency in feature naming and burn severity labeling across all merged fire events.
        - Encoded categorical burn severity labels (High, Moderate, Low, Unburned) for model compatibility.
        - Standardized all continuous input features (dNBR, SPI, VCI, NDVI) to ensure uniform scaling.
    - Feature Engineering:
        - Retained the same core environmental indicators as Week 4 to maintain consistency in model comparison:
            - dNBR (Differenced Normalized Burn Ratio): burn severity indicator.
            - NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index): vegetation greeness and health.
            - VCI (Vegetation Condition Index): short-term vegetation stress.
            - SPI (Standardized Precipitation Index): drought and moisture anomaly metric.
        - Reshaped features for CNN compatibility, treating each sample as a 1D input vector representing multi-spectral conditions.
    - Model Development:
        - Split dataset into training (70%) and test (30%) subsets with stratified sampling to preserve class ratios.
        - Evaluated CNN model using:
            - Confusion matrix, classification report, and ROC-AUC for multi-class performance.
        - Compared CNN test accuracy and macro AUC against Week 4 baseline models.
        - The CNN achieved comparable overall accuracy but showed improved sensitivity for minority (burned) 
        classes, indicating better recognition of rare severe burn areas.
    - Model Comparison and Analysis:
        - Compiled and visualized results alongside Logistic Regression and Random Forest models.
        - Observed that:
            - The CNN model captured more nuanced relationships among drought, vegetation, and burn severity indicators.
            - Baseline models remained strong for general classification but less effective for distinguishing moderate to high severity pixels.
        - Exported model metrics to a structured results file for ongoing project tracking and future evaluation.

Next Steps:
    - Visualize model outputs as risk probability maps
    - Overlay results on satellite basemaps
    - Compare predicted "high-risk" zones with historical fire perimeters.
