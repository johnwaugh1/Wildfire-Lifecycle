Objective: Gather and preprocess data for 5 historical fire events, including vegetation, drought,
and burn severity indices, and generate clean datasets ready for labeling and modeling.

Tasks Completed:
    - Selected 5 fire events:
        - Dixie Fire (2021)
        - Camp Fire (2018)
        - Bootleg Fire (2021)
        - East Troublesome Fire (2020)
        - Caldor Fire (2021)
        - Carr Fire (2018)
        - Thomas Fire (2017)
        - Creek Fire (2020)
        - Woolsey Fire (2018)
        - Glass Fire (2020)
    - Develop preprocessing notebook:
        - Added function to compute vegetation indices.
        - Implemented cloud-masked composites for pre-fire imagery.
        - Computed drought indices and burn severity indexes.
    - Added visualization function to display exported rasters for quality checking.

Outputs Generated:
    - Vegetation Indices: NDVI, EVI, NBR per fire (except Bootleg).
    - VCI and SPI drought metrics for all fires.
    - dNBR burn severity labels for 4 fires.
    - Clean, cloud-masked rasters.

Issues and Fixes:
    - Bootleg Fire dNBR and vegetation indices failed:
        - Likely due to request size for such a large AOI.
        - Attempted increasing scale but still exceeded request size limit
        for dNBR.
        - Could consider further increasing the scale in the future.

Next Steps:
    - Finalize labeling function to convert dNBR rasters into severity classes.
    - Merge all feature layers (vegetation, drought, topography, climate) into a 
    single multi-band dataset per fire.
    - Handle Bootleg gap by revisting failed export using a tiling approach.
