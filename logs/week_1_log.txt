# Week 1 Technical Log #
John Waugh and Nathan Care

Objective: Extend wildfire dataset collection to multiple historical fire events and export raster data for ML training. Downsample large climate and vegetation datasets to avoid request size errors and verify data visually before analysis.

Datasets:
    Labels:
        - MODIS MCD64A1 Burned Area (per fire event)
    Vegetation/Fuel:
        - Sentinel-2 NDVI (prefire mean)
        - ESA WorldCover 10m land cover classification
    Climate/Drought:
        - ERA5-Land hourly temperature, reduced to mean over fire period
        - CHIRPS daily precipitation, reduced to cumulative total over fire period
    Topography:
        - SRTM 30m Digital Elevation Model

Fire Events and Timeframes:
    - Dixie Fire, Northern California, 2021-07-13 - 2021-10-25
    - Camp Fire, California, 2018-11-08 - 2018-11-25
    - Bear Fire, California, 2020-08-17 - 2020-10-20
    - North Complex Fire, California, 2020-08-18 - 2020-12-03
    - Glass Fire, California, 2020-09-27 - 2020-10-20

Summary:
    - Implemented notebook to loop over multiple fire AOIs and automatically export MODIS, NDVI, landcover, ERA5, CHIRPS, and SRTM data
    - Downsampled NDVI, ERA5, and CHIRPS to avoid Earth Engine request size limits
    - Visualized raster outputs for sanity checking using matplotlib and rasterio
    - Confirmed MODIS burned areas are small but correctly aligned; NDVI and DEM require colormap visualization; ESA WorldCover loaded successfully; CHIRPS and ERA5 reduced successfully to single-band images

Key Findings:
    - Multi-fire AOI processing successfully automates dataset export
    - Downsampling and temporal reduction solves request size issues
    - Raster outputs ready for preprocessing and ML feature extraction
    - VIIRS FRP excluded due to empty band issues, can be reconsidered later

Next Steps:
    - Complete additional data exploration and preprocessing (resampling, stacking, normalization)
    - Begin feature engineering for predictive ML models (spread prediction, post-fire analysis)
    - Prepare datasets for Week 2 modeling exercises
