John Waugh and Nathan Care

Objective: Explore and select datasets for wildfire risk prediction
and severity analysis using Google Earth Engine.

Datasets:
    Labels:
        - MODIS MCD64A1 Burned Area
        - VIIRS VNP14IMG Active Fires
    Vegetation/Fuel:
        - Sentinel-2 NDVI
        - ESA WorldCover 10m land cover classification
    Climate/Drought:
        - ERA5-Land hourly climate data
        - CHIRPS daily precipitation
    Topography:
        - SRTM 30m Digital Elevation Model

Area of Interest and Timeframe:
    - Bounding box around Dixie Fire footprint in Northern California
    - June-October 2021 (pre-fire and active fire period)

Summary:
    - Visualized datasets interactively using geemap in a Jupyter Notebook
    - Verified MODIS and VIIRS captured the Dixie Fire burn scar and active
    fire signature
    - Generated NDVI pre-fire vegetation map and CHIRPS rainfall totals leading
    up to ignition
    - Loaded ERA5 temperature data to examine heat anomalies
    - Retrieved alnd cover and elevation as static featuers

Key Findings:
    - MODIS burned area data shows clear delineation of Dixie Fire scar, usable
    for training labels
    - Sentinel-2 NDVI shows good pre-fire vegetation, useful for fuel modeling
    - Climate and precipitation data confirm dry pre-fire conditions, usable as 
    predictive features

Next Steps:
    - Extract raster data as training samples
    - Begin feature engineering for predictive model
    - Define samples for ML training
